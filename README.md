# TotalNumerOfStableMatch
<b>Optimized Algorithm to find total number of Stable Match</b>

<b>Problem:Given an instance of StableMatching determine the number of stable matches.</b>

<b>Input Format:</b>The input file will be called input1.txt and be in the same directory as the java and class files.Line 0 will be a single integer n, the number of men (or women).  Lines 1 to n will be the preferences of the n men where each line is a space seperated permutation of{1,2, . . . , n}.  Lines n+1 to n+n will be the preferences of the n women where each line is a space seperated permutation of{1,2, . . . , n}.

<b>Output:</b>A single number which is the number of different stable matches.

Examples:If the input was  </br> 2 </br>
1 2 </br>
1 2 </br>
1 2 </br>
1 2 </br>
then the output woud be 1. </br> </br>

If the input was </br>
2 </br>
1 2 </br>
2 1 </br>
2 1 </br>
1 2 </br>
then the output woud be 2 </br> </br>
