# TotalNumerOfStableMatch
Optimized Algorithm to find total number of Stable Match

Problem:Given an instance of StableMatching determine the number of stable matches.

Input Format:The input file will be called input1.txt and be in the same directory as the java and class files.Line 0 will be a single integer n, the number of men (or women).  Lines 1 to n will be the preferences of the n men where each line is a space seperated permutation of{1,2, . . . , n}.  Lines n+1 to n+n will be the preferences of the n women where each line is a space seperated permutation of{1,2, . . . , n}.

Output:A single number which is the number of different stable matches.

Examples:If the input was 2 </br>
1 2
1 2
1 2
1 2
then the output woud be 1.

If the input was
2
1 2
2 1
2 1
1 2
then the output woud be 2
